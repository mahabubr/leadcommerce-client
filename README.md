## ðŸ”§ Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your application locally. For example:

1. Clone the ecommerce-backend repository:

```sh

git clone https://github.com/mahabubr/leadcommerce-client

```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh

npm install

```

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy your Node.js application using GitHub Actions, follow these simplified steps:

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**: Make changes to your Node.js application code as needed.

2. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes to the `main` branch.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update application code"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**: Push the committed changes to your GitHub repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions will automatically trigger a workflow when changes are pushed to the `main`
   branch. This workflow performs the following tasks:

   - Builds your main branch with github action..
   - Deploys the updated application to your server.

5. **Monitor Deployment**: Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow progress on your GitHub repository's Actions tab. The
   workflow will display the status of each step, including building, pushing, and deploying.

6. **Access Deployed Application**: Once the workflow is completed successfully, your Node.js application should be
   deployed and accessible. You can access it via the specified URL or domain name.

That's it! Your application is automatically deployed whenever you push changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub
repository. This streamlined process minimizes manual deployment steps for users.
